The paper "Faithful and Accurate Self-Attention Attribution for Message Passing Neural Networks via the Computation Tree Viewpoint" was **accepted** in **AAAI 2025** where I am the first author. Thanks to Prof. Shin for the supervision and to the reviewers! The paper is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04612). See you in Philadelphia!
