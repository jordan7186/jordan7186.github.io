I will start my month-long journey to the **University of New South Wales (UNSW)** in Sydney, Australia, as a visiting researcher. I will be working with [**Prof. Xin Cao**](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=kJIkUagAAAAJ&hl=en) and his group on explanation methods for graph neural networks. I am excited to meet new people and learn new things!
