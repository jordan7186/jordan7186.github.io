The paper "Explainable gait recognition with prototyping encoder-decoder" has been **accepted** to **Plos One**, where I participated as a co-author by suggesting to apply SA and LRP for explainability in gait recognition, developing the validation strategy by comparing with occusion-based results, conducting experiments and writing. Thanks to all the co-authors and the reviewers! The paper is available [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0264783).
