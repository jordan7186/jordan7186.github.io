The paper "Prototype-Based Explanations for Graph Neural Networks (Student Abstract)" has been **accepted** to **AAAI 2022** and was **selected as one of the finalists for oral presentation**. I participated as the first author and thanks to all the co-authors and the reviewers! The paper is available [here](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/21660).
