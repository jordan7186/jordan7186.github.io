The paper "Turbo-CF: Matrix Decomposition-Free Graph Filtering for Fast Recommendation‚Äù was **accepted** in **SIGIR 2024 (Short track)**, where I participated as the second author by participating in the experiments (e.g., runtime measurements, baselines) and writing. Thanks to all the co-authors and the reviewers! The paper will be available soon.
