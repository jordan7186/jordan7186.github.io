The extended version of my LoG paper "Propagate & Distill: Towards Effective Graph Learners Using Propagation-Embracing MLPs" has been accepted to the journal **Knowledge-Based Systems** (title: "Unveiling the unseen potential of graph learning through MLPs: Effective graph learners using propagation-embracing MLPs"). Thanks to Prof. Shin for the supervision and to the reviewers! The paper is available [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950705124009316) as well as the [arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11759).
