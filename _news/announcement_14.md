I started a new position as a research scientist intern at LG AI Research in Seoul, South Korea, from June 2025. I will be working on applying machine learning methods to chemical and material science problems, and I am excited to contribute to the research in this area. I am grateful for the opportunity and look forward to collaborating with the LG AI Research team.
