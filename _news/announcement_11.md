The paper "On the Feasibility of Fidelity$$^{-}$$ for Graph Pruning" was **accepted** in **IJCAI 2024 Workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)** where I am the first author. Thanks to Prof. Shin for the supervision and to the reviewers! The paper is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11504v1).
