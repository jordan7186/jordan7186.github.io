My team was awarded **The Yound Data Journalist of the Year** at the **3rd Data Journalism Korea Conference**, where I particiapted in collecting and processing raw data for the "ghost protests" in Seoul, alongside analysis and visualization. Thanks to all the team members and the organizers of the event!
