    In my lab, we have a weekly reading group where we present papers of our own interest. 
    Here are some of the selected presentations that I have made in the reading group.
  
  items:
    - title: "Causal Learning"
      description: >
        A two-part presentation introducing the basics of causal learning. I got a LOT of help from 
        <a href="https://www.bradyneal.com/causal-inference-course">"Introduction to Causal Inference" by Brady Neal</a>. 
        Definitely check out his course if you are interested — I personally had a lot of fun learning from it.
      materials:
        - type: slides
          title: "Part 1"
          url: "/assets/pdf/Causal_learning_part1.pdf"
        - type: slides
          title: "Part 2"
          url: "/assets/pdf/Causal_learning_part2.pdf"

    - title: "Self-Supervised Learning"
      description: >
        A presentation made when I was interested in understanding the SimCLR framework. 
        Understanding this paper helped me better understand other papers in graph self-supervised learning.

        - type: slides
          title: "Introduction to SimCLR"

    - title: "Knowledge Distillation"
      description: >
        A presentation made when I was interested in understanding knowledge distillation, 
        which I eventually applied to my research on GNN-to-MLP knowledge distillation.
      materials:
        - type: slides
          title: "Towards understanding knowledge distillation"
          url: "/assets/pdf/Knowledge_distillation.pdf"

    - title: "Physics-Informed Machine Learning"
      description: >
        A presentation made when I was interested in understanding the physics-informed machine learning landscape.
      materials:
        - type: slides
          title: "Vector Neurons: A General Framework for SO(3)-Equivariant Networks"
          url: "/assets/pdf/Vector_Neurons.pdf"

    - title: "Unsupervised Disentanglement"
      description: >
        A review of the paper: "Challenging common assumptions in the unsupervised learning of 
        disentangled representations" by Locatello et al. This paper is a great read if you are 
        interested in disentangled representation learning, and personally, I found it very helpful 
        while reading some papers in explainable AI.
