Hello! I am a Ph.D candidate in [MIDaS Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/midasyonsei) led by *Prof. Won-Yong Shin*, [Dept. Computer Science & Engineering](https://cse.yonsei.ac.kr/cse/index.do) in Yonsei University, South Korea. Before joining MIDaS, I graduated from Yonsei University in Feb. 2019 as a physics major. 

My primary interest is to find elegant and simple solutions to interesting and important problems on **graph data** and **graph neural networks (GNNs).** More specifically, my main research topics are currently focused on…

- **Explainabiliy** in graph neural networks
- **Efficient** graph learning

I also have research experiences in…

- **Time-series with INR**
- **Graph representation learning**
- **Explainable healthcare**
