## External presentations

## Seminar series @ GIST
This is a series of seminars that I gave at Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) as a guest speaker from March ~ June 2025. The seminar series was about the basics of graph neural networks, several fundamental concepts, and applications of GNNs.

**(Slides TBA)**

## Seminar @ Ehwa Womans University
This is a seminar that I gave at Ehwa Womans University as a guest speaker in April 2025.

**(Slides TBA)**

#### PAGE: Prototype-Based Model-Level Explanations for Graph Neural Networks
This presentation slides were submitted as an official supplementary material after being accepted as the best academic paper at the Graduate School of Yonsei University.

Also, this is the poster that I presented for the short version, accepted at AAAI 2022.

#### Edgeless-GNN: Unsupervised Inductive Edgeless Network Embedding
This presentation was given during the 28th Samsung HumanTech award, which eventually led to the award of the bronze prize.

## Internal presentations

#### Causal learning

This was a two-part presentation where I introduced the basics of causal learning in an internal seminar at my lab, which I got a LOT of help from ["Introduction to Causal Inference" by Brady Neal](https://www.bradyneal.com/causal-inference-course). Thank you!!

Slide 2: [Causal learning: Part 2](/assets/pdf/Causal_learning_part2.pdf)

#### Self-supervised learning

- [Introduction to SimCLR](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aafQ5f6egM1TGsZXehRzzp1Z6coHRhqY/view?usp=sharing): This was a presentation made when I was interested in understanding the SimCLR framework.

#### Knowledge distillation

- [Towards understanding knowledge distillation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nf40Y0ZuSJVzOlObBczgkJ0ksqeHzvg-/view?usp=sharing): This was a presentation made when I was interested in understanding knowledge distillation, which I eventually applied to my research on efficient graph learning.

#### Physics-informed machine learning (PIML)

- A review of the paper: [Vector Neurons: A General Framework for SO(3)-Equivariant Networks](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BeaBhggwPEDEFIDJLQqg8mz_CN9tQe-p/view?usp=sharing) by Dent et al. This was a presentation made when I was interested in understanding the physics-informed machine learning landscape.

#### Unsupervised disentanglement

- A review of the paper: [Challenging common assumptions in the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HS-CQ_xUj0D8hbzmQORz0K7_B8ptG6gj/view?usp=sharing) by Locatello et al.
