## External presentations (Selected)

### Seminar series @ GIST

This is a series of seminars that I gave at Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) as a guest speaker in Prof. Hong Kook Kim's group from March ~ May 2025. The seminar series covers the basics of graph neural networks, several fundamental concepts, and applications.

**Session 1:** [Introduction to graph mining and graph neural networks](/assets/pdf/[GIST]01_Introduction_to_graph_mining_and_graph_neural_networks.pdf)

**Session 2:** [On the representational power of graph neural networks](/assets/pdf/[GIST]02_On_the_representational_power_of_graph_neural_networks.pdf)

**Session 3:** [A graph signal processing viewpoint of graph neural networks](/assets/pdf/[GIST]03_A_graph_signal_processing_viewpoint_of_graph_neural_networks.pdf)

**Session 4:** [From label propagation to graph neural networks](/assets/pdf/[GIST]04_From_label_propagation_to_graph_neural_networks.pdf)

**Session 5:** [On the problem of oversmoothing and oversquashing](/assets/pdf/[GIST]05_On_the_problem_of_oversmoothing_and_oversquashing.pdf)

**Session 6:** [Towards efficient graph learning](/assets/pdf/[GIST]06_Towards_efficient_graph_learning.pdf)

**Session 7:** Explainable graph neural networks (TBA)

## Selected Internal Presentations

### Topic: Causal learning

This was a two-part presentation where I introduced the basics of causal learning in an internal seminar at my lab, which I got a LOT of help from ["Introduction to Causal Inference" by Brady Neal](https://www.bradyneal.com/causal-inference-course). Thank you!!

**Slide 1:** [Causal learning: Part 1](/assets/pdf/Causal_learning_part1.pdf)

**Slide 2:** [Causal learning: Part 2](/assets/pdf/Causal_learning_part2.pdf)

### Topic: Self-supervised learning

This was a presentation made when I was interested in understanding the SimCLR framework.

**Slide:** [Introduction to SimCLR](/assets/pdf/SimCLR.pdf)

### Topic: Knowledge distillation

Towards understanding knowledge distillation: This was a presentation made when I was interested in understanding knowledge distillation, which I eventually applied to my research on efficient graph learning.

**Slide:** [Towards understanding knowledge distillation](/assets/pdf/Knowledge_distillation.pdf)

### Topic: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML)

A review of the paper: Vector Neurons: A General Framework for SO(3)-Equivariant Networks by Dent et al. This was a presentation made when I was interested in understanding the physics-informed machine learning landscape.

**Slide:** [Vector Neurons: A General Framework for SO(3)-Equivariant Networks](/assets/pdf/Vector_Neurons.pdf)

### Topic: Unsupervised disentanglement
